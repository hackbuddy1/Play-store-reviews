Google Play Store Sentiment Analysis Project
üìú Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive sentiment analysis of customer reviews for a Google Play Store application. The primary goal is to move beyond simple star ratings and understand the 'why' behind customer feedback. By processing and analyzing the unstructured text of reviews, this project extracts actionable insights that can help business stakeholders (like product managers and developers) make data-driven decisions.
üéØ Key Objectives
Data Cleaning: To process and clean a raw dataset of Google Play Store reviews, making it suitable for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: To programmatically assign a sentiment score (Positive, Negative, Neutral) to each customer review.
Insight Generation: To identify the core strengths and weaknesses of the application directly from the voice of the customer.
Actionable Recommendations: To provide clear, data-backed recommendations for business improvement.
üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries Used
Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
TextBlob: For performing sentiment analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static data visualizations.
WordCloud: For generating insightful word clouds from text data.
Environment: Jupyter Notebook (via VS Code)
üìÇ Project Workflow
Data Loading & Exploration: The dataset containing user reviews was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. An initial exploration was conducted to understand its structure, identify missing values, and irrelevant columns.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Irrelevant columns (reviewCreatedVersion, replyContent, etc.) were dropped to focus on the core data.
A text cleaning pipeline was created to:
Convert all review text to lowercase.
Remove all punctuation and special characters.
This standardized text was stored in a new content_clean column.
Sentiment Analysis:
The TextBlob library was used to calculate a polarity score for each cleaned review (ranging from -1 for negative to +1 for positive).
Based on the polarity score, each review was classified into 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral' sentiment categories.
Visualization & Insight Generation:
A bar chart was created to visualize the overall distribution of sentiments.
Two word clouds were generated to identify the most frequently used words in positive and negative reviews, respectively.
‚ú® Key Insights & Results
1. Overall Sentiment is Largely Positive
The analysis showed that a majority of the users have a positive sentiment towards the application, indicating a healthy and well-received core product.

2. Core Strength: Simplicity and Ease of Use
The positive word cloud was dominated by terms like "easy", "simple", "great", and "love". This strongly suggests that the app's biggest strength is its user-friendly interface.

3. Critical Weakness: Performance & Stability
The negative word cloud was the most actionable insight. It was dominated by terms like "crashes", "slow", "error", and "not working". This reveals that the primary reason for user frustration is not missing features, but poor technical performance.

üöÄ Business Recommendations
For the Marketing Team: Leverage the app's core strength. Marketing campaigns should heavily feature the "simplicity" and "ease of use" of the app.
For the Development Team: The highest priority should be a "bug-fixing sprint". Resources should be allocated to improve app stability, reduce crashes, and increase speed. This will directly address the biggest customer pain point and likely improve ratings.
